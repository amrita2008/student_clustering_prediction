## 🔬 Methodology

1. Collected and processed 18,000+ student records  
2. Encoded categorical features into numeric representations  
3. Standardized numerical features for clustering  
4. Applied KMeans clustering to segment students into 4 distinct groups  
5. Exposed trained model through a FastAPI-based inference service  
6. Built a public Streamlit dashboard to interact with the live ML API
